# b_ls

This is my own version of the `ls` command for terminal. Created as a part of the FT_LS project at 42 Silicon Valley. 

## Usage

Clone repository, navigate into the repository folder, run `make` command to compile an executable binary.

You can run `./ft_ls` with these flags -> `-a` / `-l` / `-s` / `-t`.
